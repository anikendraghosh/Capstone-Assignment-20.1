# AI-Powered Dirt Bike Recommender: Final Report

## **Define the Problem Statement**

This project's goal is to develop an AI-driven machine learning solution that recommends suitable dirt bikes for beginner riders. New riders often face challenges in selecting an appropriate first bike from a wide range of options, and an incorrect choice can negatively impact their safety, confidence, and overall enjoyment of the sport. The primary benefit of this solution is to provide personalized and safe recommendations that enhance a beginner's initial riding experience.

## **Model Outcomes or Predictions**

The model will utilize **supervised learning** algorithms. The problem is framed as a **classification task**, where the model will learn from various rider and bike attributes to predict the most suitable bike for a user.

The expected output of the model will be a specific bike recommendation or a category of bike (e.g., "small trail bike") that is best suited to the beginner rider's profile.

## **Data Acquisition**

To ensure the best results, data will be acquired from multiple sources. The key datasets required for this model are:

* **Rider Profile Data**: This includes personal attributes such as age, height, weight, and previous riding experience (e.g., none, bicycle, ATV).
* **Dirt Bike Specifications Data**: This dataset will contain key details about different bike models, including engine size (cc), seat height, bike weight, and the target rider skill
