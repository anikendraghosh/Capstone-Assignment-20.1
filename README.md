# AI-Powered Dirt Bike Recommender for Beginners

## 1. Project Overview & Problem Statement

This project aims to solve a common challenge for new dirt bike riders: choosing the right first bike. [cite_start]The market is filled with options, and an incorrect choice can lead to a difficult learning curve, increased risk of injury, and potential abandonment of the sport. [cite: 2]

[cite_start]This project will develop an AI-driven system to provide personalized and safe dirt bike recommendations, enhancing the initial riding experience for beginners. [cite: 2]

## 2. Data Sources

The model will be trained on a comprehensive dataset derived from multiple sources to ensure robust and reliable recommendations. The key data types required are:

* [cite_start]**Rider Profile Data**: Includes personal attributes like age, height, weight, and previous riding experience (e.g., none, bicycle, ATV). [cite: 5]
* [cite_start]**Dirt Bike Specifications Data**: Contains key details about bike models, such as engine size (cc) and seat height. [cite: 6]
* [cite_start]**Expert Recommendations/Historical Data**: This data will be sourced from experienced instructors and rider reviews to serve as the "ground truth" for training the model. [cite: 7]

## 3. Methodology

The analysis follows a structured machine learning workflow:

1.  **Data Preparation**: A synthetic dataset was generated to simulate the three required data sources. The data was cleaned, and a target variable (`recommended_bike`) was engineered based on a set of logical rules simulating expert advice.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations were created to understand the distribution of rider attributes and the relationships between rider height, experience, and the recommended bike.
3.  **Baseline Modeling**: A **Decision Tree Classifier** was chosen as the baseline model. [cite_start]This algorithm is highly effective for this problem and offers transparent, explainable recommendations, which is a key benefit for the target audience. [cite: 17]
4.  **Evaluation**: The model's performance was evaluated using **accuracy** as the primary metric, which is suitable for the balanced dataset created for this analysis.

## 4. Results & Findings

The EDA and baseline modeling process yielded several key findings:

* **Feature Importance**: The EDA visualizations confirmed that **rider height** and **prior experience level** are the most significant factors in determining a suitable beginner dirt bike.
* **Baseline Model Performance**: The Decision Tree baseline model performed exceptionally well on the test set, achieving **99% accuracy**. This indicates that the model was successfully able to learn the underlying rules from the training data.
* **Model Interpretability**: The decision tree provides a clear, rule-based flowchart for its recommendations. This transparency is a major finding, as it allows non-technical users to understand and trust the logic behind the suggestions.

## 5. Recommendations & Next Steps

This analysis successfully demonstrates a proof-of-concept for the recommender system. The next steps will focus on advancing the model for real-world application:

* **Acquire Real-World Data**: Transition from synthetic data to real-world data collected from dealerships, riders, and riding schools.
* [cite_start]**Develop Additional Models**: Build and evaluate more complex models, such as the recommender systems and regression models initially proposed, to compare performance against the baseline. [cite: 10, 18]
* [cite_start]**Refine Feature Engineering**: Incorporate additional features like rider fitness level and intended terrain to create more nuanced recommendations. [cite: 5]
